      <p id="info_details_test">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is located at the Center Point of world 's Magnetic Equator.Of the "Pancha bootha" i.e. 5 temples, Chidambaram denotes the Skies. Kalahasthi denotes Wind. Kanchi Ekambareswar denotes land. All these 3 temples are located in a straight line at 79 degrees 41 minutes Longitude. This can be verified using Google. An amazing fact & astronomical miracle !Chidambaram temple is based on the Human Body having 9 Entrances denoting 9 Entrances or Openings of the body.Temple roof is made of 21600 gold sheets which denotes the 21600 breaths taken by a human being every day (15 x 60 x 24 = 21600).These 21600 gold sheets are fixed on the Gopuram using 72000 gold nails which denote the total no. of Nadis (Nerves) in the human body. These transfer energy to certain body parts that are invisible.Thirumoolar states that man represents the shape of Shivalingam, which represents Chidambaram which represents Sadashivam which represents HIS dance! "Ponnambalam " is placed slightly tilted towards the left. This represents our Heart. To reach this, we need to climb 5 steps called "Panchatshara padi " "Si, Va, Ya, Na, Ma " are the 5 Panchatshara mantras.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 4 pillars holding the Kanagasabha representing the 4 Vedas.Ponnambalam has 28 pillars denoting the 28 "Ahamas "as well as the 28 methods to worship Lord Shiva. These 28 pillars support 64 +64 Roof Beams which denote the 64 Arts. The cross beams represent the Blood Vessels running across the Human body.9 Kalasas on the Golden Roof represent the 9 types of Sakthi or Energies.The 6 pillars at the Artha Mantapa represent the 6 types of Sashtras.The 18 pillars in the adjacant Mantapa represents 18 Puranams.The dance of Lord Nataraja is described as Cosmic Dance by Western Scientists.Whatever Science is propounding now has been stated by Hinduism thousands of years ago<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the ancient time, it is believed that there's a secret hidden in plain sight inside the temple, which is invisible to the commoners.In the temple, there's a space which is covered with a curtain, which will only be unveiled during special pujas. Golden vilvam leaves are placed behind this curtain, and that's what the Chidambara Ragasiyam is all about.But what does this symbolises?Many have tried to decode the secret, as to what the empty space and the golden leaves represent. But there is no definite answer for this to to-date.Some say that the saints and sages can see Shiva and Parvathi in their true form behind the curtain. And the golden leaves serve as mere decoration for the lord.While some say that the curtain represents 'maya' - which means illusion - and a person can see his real self by removing the maya.Chithambaram is also known as one of the temples in the Pancha Bhoota stalams located in South India, and Chidambaram serves as the temple which represents space.Even though the temple is said to have an 'Akasha Lingam' (Shivalingam which represents space), but there is no physical lingam available in the temple contrary to the other four Pancha Bhootha stalams which represents earth, water, fire, and air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, some believe that the Chidambara ragasiyam refers to the Shivalingam which exist in the temple in the form of space, and is invisible to commoners.But no matter what the interpretation might be, the legends say that Chidambara Ragasiyam will never be revealed as the secret is varies depending on each individual, and it is up to them to realise its true meaning.The statue is located at centre of magnetic radiation. the world runs because of cosmic rays. cosmic rays provide energy for earth to rotate. so chidambaram is the point where rays exit from earth. Finding this before 3000 years is a huge achievement.Albert Einstein found theory of relativity. According to his theory, the world is 3 dimensional. there is 4th dimension i.e., time. we can actually expand or contract time..
